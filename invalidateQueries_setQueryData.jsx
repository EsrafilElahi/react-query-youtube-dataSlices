// The line queryClient.setQueryData(['video', videoId], updatedVideo) is used in React Query to manually update the data in the query cache for a specific query. Here's what each part of the code means:

// queryClient: It refers to the instance of the QueryClient provided by the QueryClientProvider. The queryClient is responsible for managing the query cache and performing operations on it.

// setQueryData: It is a method provided by the queryClient that allows you to update the data in the query cache for a specific query.

// ['video', videoId]: It is the query key used to identify the specific query in the cache. The query key is an array that uniquely identifies the query. In this case, it consists of the string 'video' and the videoId variable, which could be an identifier for a specific video.

// updatedVideo: It is the new data that you want to set in the query cache for the specified query key. In this case, updatedVideo is the updated video object that you received after a successful update.

// By calling queryClient.setQueryData(['video', videoId], updatedVideo), you are manually updating the data for the 'video' query with the specific videoId in the query cache. This allows you to immediately update the UI with the new data without making a network request. The UI components subscribed to this query will receive the updated data from the cache and reflect the changes accordingly.

// It's important to note that using setQueryData directly modifies the cache, so it should be used with caution. Make sure that the updated data reflects the actual state on the server to avoid inconsistencies.
